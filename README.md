## Description

The third challenge of the class, and the most exciting so far. Javascript is very engaging and the logic is something to work toward. This project tracks employee information as well as returning an everage salary to the console, and choosing an employee at random. To do this, it requires three funtcions on my part. First, prompting the user for information and organizing that information in an object (See examples 1 and 2 below). Then we calculate an average salary and report that to the console using a template literal (See example 3 below). Finally, we choose a random employee for a contest using the Math and random methods (See example 4 below).

~~~js
Example 1: 
const firstName = prompt("Enter first name?");
    const lastName = prompt("Enter last name?");
    const salaryAdd = prompt("Enter yearly salary?");

Example 2:
let employee = {
      firstName: firstName,
      lastName: lastName,
      salary: salary
    };

Example 3:
console.log(`The average employee salary between our ${employeesArray.length} employee(s) is ${averageSalary.toFixed(2)}.`);

Example 4:
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * employeesArray.length);
